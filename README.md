Type conversion 
String conversion 
String conversion refers to the process of converting data from one data type to a string data type.
This is a common operation in programming when you need to represent non-string data, such as numbers or objects,
as a sequence of characters. String conversion is essential for tasks such as displaying data, logging information, or interacting with users through text interfaces.
In many programming languages, including Python, Java, JavaScript, and C++, you can convert non-string data types to strings using built-in functions or methods.

The string conversion happens when we need the outcome value to be a string. When you have a different data type and now you desire to change the data type to a string.
string conversion is logical/obvious, for example false will remain false and null will remain null. 

Boolean Conversion
Boolean conversion, also known as boolean casting or type coercion, refers to the process of converting data to a boolean value.
In many programming languages, this conversion typically results in either true or false, representing the logical values of "true" or "false", respectively.
Boolean conversion is often used in logical operations, conditional statements, and comparisons. Boolean conversion is fundamental for decision-making in programming,
as it enables the evaluation of conditions and the execution of specific code blocks based on whether a condition is true or false. Understanding how data is implicitly or
explicitly converted to boolean values is crucial for writing reliable and readable code.

Numeric Conversionâ€¯ 
Numeric conversion, also known as implicit type conversion or type coercion, often occurs automatically in mathematical functions and expressions in programming languages.
This process involves converting data from one numeric type to another as needed to perform arithmetic operations or evaluations. Implicit numeric conversion helps ensuring
that operations involving different numeric types can be executed smoothly without explicit conversion by the programmer. 

Converting variables into numbers:
When you wish to change a variable to a number you can use the following methods of parseFloat and parseInt as well as number with brackets.
Number()
parseFloat
parseInt

The Document Object Model and JavaScript Syntax:
The Document Object Model is an Application Programming Interface (API) for HTML and XML documents. It does two things for web developers: 

1. Provides a structural representation of the document
2. Defines the way that that structure is to be accessed from script
